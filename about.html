       <h1>Meet Susan Shelton Perry</h1>
     
         <img class="img-buisness" src="./img/buisness.jpg" alt="buisness">
            
           <p> I have been practicing law for 
            39 years now. I am a lifelong resident of Logan County, a graduate of Logan High, Marshall University and WVU. 
            I am a retired state employee, having spent most of my adult life working for agencies in WV state government. 
            After graduating from Marshall I got a job as a social worker, working in the foster care system.  
            After 3 years of social work in Logan and Boone Counties, I returned to college at WVU and graduated with a Juris Doctor degree.<br></br>
             While in law school I met and married the love of my life Roger Perry.  We have lived for the last 40 years in Neibert in Logan County.  
             This is where we raised our two sons, Phillip and Matthew.  
             In addition to my husband and my sons, my family has now grown to include my daughter-in-law Margaret Perry and my granddaughters Elyssa and Livia Perry.

           <h1>Why You Should Vote For Susan</h1>

             <p>Within a few years after law school I accepted an appointment in the first class of Family Law Masters. 
                I was assigned to serve Lincoln, Boone and Wayne Counties, with Mingo County being added to the list later in my term.  
                 I worked as a Family Law Master from 1986 to 1997.  In 1999 I returned to state employment by accepting a position at the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement.  
                 In 1999 I moved from the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement to a position as the Deputy Secretary. In 2001 I was tapped by Governor Bob Wise to lead this 400-person agency.<br></br>  
                 During my 8 years at the helm, the agency was recognized federally for its significant improvements in establishing paternity and support orders.
                 After retiring from DHHR, I went back to work part-time for the WV Supreme Court of Appeals as a Temporary Family Court Judge.  
                 This is similar to a substitute teacher position.  I would be appointed to preside in Family Courts around the state when a Family Court Judge was unable to preside because of illness, conflict of interest or resignation.  
                 By the time I resigned that position in January 2018 I had presided in almost half of the counties in the state.<br></br>
                 I strongly believe in the betterment of our education system so much so that during the 2018 Teacher Strike across West Virginia, I stood with the teachers of West Virginia in Charleston at the Capital in protest against legislation. There needs to be a dedicated funding source for PEIA in order to keep our education and state employees afloat. In order to build our local economies, we need to support our small, local businesses and create a low-interest fund to assist those small business owners. 
                 As for statewide economic growth, I support passing a prevailing wage legislation.

               <h1>Since Retirement</h1>
                  <p>
                      In retirement I have continued to be active in our community. 
                      I am a member of the Board of Directors of Southern Coalition for the ARTS, a member of the Board of Directors of the Logan Child Advocacy Center and the current Secretary of the Logan Lions Club.  
                      <br></br> As a part of my Lions work, I helped to establish and maintain four Little Free Libraries around the county which provides free books to everyone.  
                       I recently completed two terms on the Board of Directors of Davis Stuart Inc., a residential, therapeutic child care facility in Lewisburg, WV.<br></br> 
                      We provide therapy, education, and family-style home life for teens who are unable to live with their families. 
                      I am a lifelong member of the First Presbyterian Church of Logan, where I sing in the choir and teach an adult Christian Education class.  
                      In 2017 I served as the Moderator of the Presbytery of West Virginia, an association of over 100 Presbyterian churches in our region. 
                      I am also in charge of our churchâ€™s Blessing Box ministry.  We have a box outside our church where we place food items, toiletries, cleaning supplies, used clothing, small household items.
